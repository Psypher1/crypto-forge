# Crypto Forge


This is a recreation of [**Crypto Dash**](https://crypto-dash-two.vercel.app/) the same project by Brad Traversy but in Nuxt.
Most of the functionality is the same. This was in an effort to see how thing change and learn some more Nuxt concepts.

## Built with
- Nuxt
- NuxtUI

## What Changed
- Data fetched via server api routes
- Composable centralises data fetching
